              <li>In my opinion, the most important benefit of being a part of SheHacks, a TinkerHub WIT initiative is that I can collaborate and work with a team to learn and build a project.

              <li>Completing the task on time with my teammates will definitely improve my confidence in future projects.I believe that being a part of this venture will help me to boost my coding skills.

              <li>In my opinion,a bootcamp is a wonderful oppurtunity to master tech skills because it focuses on intense,short term training on the fundamental skills that will help us to grab the concepts quickly and also apply them to build real world projects.</li>
               <li> It will also help to gain lot of knowledge on a particular topic and learn skills in as little as a few weeks time,which will all allow me to sharpen my coding skills faster.
              </li>
              <li>Programming with my peers forces me to develop my ability to communicate my ideas and solutions out loud,as well as the ability to work together and and collaborate towards a common goal.</li>
              <li>I hope that the effort we take for the team work we do now will definitely help us in our future when we have to work in a firm which demands high levels of cooperation and coordination among members.I also want to thank TinkerHub WIT for this opportunity to boost our skills.
